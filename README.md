# trajectory_outliers_detection
trajectory outlier detection, n-gram language model, natural language processing(NLP)

The main question to be addressed in this project is the following: Given a set of known trajectories T, can we identify if a new trajectory t is an outlier w.r.t. T? That can be used to detect, for instance, accidents or other significant events on a road network, suspicious activities or elderly people lost.![image](https://github.com/shinesday/trajectory_outliers_detection/assets/26208419/4a10aa13-808d-4b50-a363-e1b439a5b6a8)
